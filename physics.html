                <p>FPV flying involves a video feed
                    coming black from your aircraft to whatever device you are using to display your video.
                    Subsequently, you will have video flowing both ways - from your radio on the drone to the goggles or
                    screen for the video. Click <a href="partsandequipment.html"> here</a> to learn more about the parts
                    and equipment needed to fly FPV.<br><br>

                    For the connection between the radio and the RC control to work properly, you need to understand
                    what exactly is going on between the two devices (e.g the frequencies used and how to avoid
                    problems.) The last thing you need is your drone losing connection with your controller and
                    therefore crashing!<br><br>

                    Essentially an FPV drone requires two subsystems, a video system and a control link system, in order
                    for a pilot to fly.<br><br>

                    In terms of drone physics, the motors on the quadcopter act like wings on a plane.
                    They create lift by rotating at fast speeds, which
                    pulls the air downwards and pushes the quadcopter
                    drone in the air. <br>
                    <br>
                    If the lift cancels out with the acting force of
                    gravity, then the net force becomes zero and the quad
                    hovers in midair. <br>
                    <br>
                    A directional thrust makes the quadcopter to move in
                    that direction. <br>
                    <br>

                    There are 4 main axes in which one can control a drone, by using the radio transmitter:
                <ul>
                    <li>Roll: Moving to left or right with
                        respect to the front of the drone.</li>
                    <li>Pitch:Moving the drone forward or backwards.</li>
                    <li>Yaw: Pivoting or turning from the left or
                        right. (The drone rotates around the center.)</li>
                    <li style="list-style: none;">...and last but not least...</li>

                    <li>Throttle: Moving the drone up and down</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                The following is a image to demonstrate these axes of movement:
