                <p style="text-align: left; width: 95%;margin: auto; padding: 10px;">FPV stands for “First Person
                    View”.<br><br>

                    You might have played with a Radio Control (RC) toy before, such as a toy car. Imagine that, instead
                    of looking at the vehicle from the outside, you could be virtually “sitting” inside the vehicle?
                    That’s FPV.<br><br>

                    Maybe you’ve played a video game where you fly an aircraft through a virtual environment. What if,
                    instead of flying a virtual aircraft, you could be flying a real aircraft through a real
                    environment? That’s FPV!<br><br>

                    In technical terms, our FPV Drone can be categorized as multi-rotors. A multi-rotor is an aircraft
                    that flies not by air traveling over wings, but by propellers blowing air downwards. The most common
                    multi-rotor type is a quadcopter, which has four rotors (spinny things). There are also bicopters (2
                    rotors), tricopters (3 rotors), hexacopters (6 rotors), octocopters (8 rotors), and so on. Unless
                    specified otherwise, you can assume we’re talking about a quadcopter - a drone with 4
                    motors.<br><br>

                    What makes a drone so awesome is how versatile its range of movements is. By adjusting the thrust
                    between the motors, the drone can tilt itself and move through the air in any direction. It can
                    hover in place. It can move sideways. It can move up, and down, and forwards, and backwards.<br><br>

                    This enormous amount of flexability that FPV drones offer has opened up a world of possibilities and
                    very unique angles not accomplished by other types of drones. Some of the most distnct tyoes of FPV
                    flying are the following:<br><br>
