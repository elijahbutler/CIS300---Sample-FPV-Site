                <p>There are three main styles of FPV
                    flying:</p>

                <h3>Freestyle FPV</h3>
                <p> A type of FPV flying that focuses on acrobatics, exploration, and enjoyment. Unlike FPV racing and photography/cinematography, freestyle flying doesn't have one specific objective. It's great for beginners who want to get the feel of FPV flying down. Likewise, it's where experienced FPV pilots practice tricks, train for a race, or rehearse an upcoming shot. There is no specific set of rules for how to freestyle fly, but there are lots of benefits.</p>

                <h3>Cinematic FPV</h3>
                <p>Cinematic FPV Drone flying is closely related to FPV Freestyle. In fact, the equipment is usually very similar. However, instead of focusing on stunts and tricks, Cinematic FPV aims to present expansive landscapes, breathtaking scenery, or fast-moving subjects in an aesthetically pleasing way. Cinematic FPV pilots aim to minimize camera movement, rather than drawing attention to it like with Freestyle.</p>

                <h3>Racing FPV</h3>
                <p>Drone Racing is easy to understand. Pilots race their drones around a course, and the first one to pass the finish line wins. Drone Racing tracks are usually built using “gates”, which are rectangular or circular obstacles that the pilots must pass through, as well as “flags”, which are vertical obstacles that the pilot must pass between or to one side of.<br><br>Drone Racing usually appeals to people who are highly competitive, and who like going fast. It’s not uncommon for drone racers to have enjoyed other forms of racing previously, such as motorcycle or kart racing. Drone Racing is cheaper and physically safer than other racing disciplines, while being just as exciting!.</p>
