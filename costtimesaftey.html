                    <p> As seen in the <a href="partsandequipment.html">Parts and Equipment</a> page, an FPV drone alone
                        can cost upwards of $500 for the standard 5" setup that is used across the various styles of
                        FPV. But to get to a point where you're flying around expensive luxury cars like <a
                            href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JohnnyFPV">Johnny FPV</a> here can take thousands of hours
                        practicing. </p>

                <p>
                    The best thing for an absolute beginner to do is invest in a FPV Controller and FPV Simulator. This
                    will allow you to get practice and "time on the sticks" before ever flying a real drone that you
                    could possibly crash... and lose money. Some reccomendation for beginner simulators are <a
                        href="https://www.velocidrone.com/">Velocidrone Racing Simulator</a>&nbsp;(which can run on
                    pretty much any computer), <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1278060/FPVSkyDive/"> ORQA
                        FPV.SkyDive Simulator</a>&nbsp;(which is available on PC and Android),<a
                        href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/410340/Liftoff_FPV_Drone_Racing/">Liftoff
                        Simulator</a>&nbsp;(which has amazing graphics and multiplayer capabilities).
                </p>
                <p>
                    After getting comfortable in a simulator to know you're capable of flying a real drone without
                    destroying it your first flight, it's time to do your research for all the parts that are best for
                    what style you'd like to fly, and how much you want to spend. An overlooked part of FPV by many
                    beginners is the sheer price of getting into FPV and maintaining the hobby. For example, in my <a
                        href="partsandequipment.html">Parts and Equipment</a> page, I only included in the price for the
                    drone one battery and one set of (4) propellers for the drone. But realistically, you're going to
                    want many batteries to get a good flight session in, and you're going to need spare propellers
                    incase you damage your drone's propellers during flight. A lot of little things like these add up,
                    and as you fly more, you're going to realize how many little things you'll need, not to mention the
                    cost and time of reparing your drone if you have a crash that damages some of your electronics or
                    motors.

                <h3>Laws and Regulations</h3>
                <p>According to UAV Coach, the go-to site for drone laws, as well as FAA Texts/Certifications</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>You must take The Recreational UAS Safety Test (TRUST) required by the FAA. We’re proud to be an
                        FAA-approved test administrator.</li>
                    <li>You must fly for hobby or recreation ONLY (no side jobs or in-kind work allowed).</li>
                    <li>You must register your UAV with the FAA on the <strong><a
                                href="https://faadronezone.faa.gov/#/">FAADroneZone website</a></strong>.</li>
                    <li>You must fly within visual line-of-sight.</li>
                    <li>You must follow community-based safety guidelines and fly within the programming of a nationwide
                        community-based organization (CBO) like the <a
                            href="http://www.modelaircraft.org/"><strong>AMA</strong></a>.</li>
                    <li>You must fly a drone under 55 lbs. unless certified by a community-based organization.</li>
                    <li>You must never fly near other aircraft.</li>
                    <li>You must fly in Class G airspace. If you need to fly in Class B, C, D or E controlled airspace,
                        <a href="https://www.dronepilotgroundschool.com/faa-laanc-authorization/"><strong>you need to
                                apply for airspace authorization</strong></a>.</li>
                    <li>You must never fly near emergency response efforts.</li>
                </ul>
